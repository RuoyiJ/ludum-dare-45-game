# Ludum Dare 45 Game Jam: Pastel Palette
## Theme: Start From Nothing
A simple puzzle game made for Ludum dare 45. Theme was "Start from nothing". I was supposed to finish within 2 days. However, I didn't finish in time.
Concept:
When game starts, you stands on a single block in an empty universe (9x9 grid). The space is extremely cold, and there is no road for you to move forward. Therefore, you must collect road pieces to create a path to move forword. Mainwhile, your warmness goes down whenever you move to a different block, so you have to collect flame to heat you up to prevent from dying. Keep on moving and create a pastel coloured world.
